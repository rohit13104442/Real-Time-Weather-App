# Real-Time-Weather-App

Summary:

This Streamlit app, titled "Real-Time Weather App," provides users with real-time weather information based on latitude and longitude inputs. The app utilizes web scraping techniques with BeautifulSoup to extract data from the Time and Date website.

Approach:
-	Web Scraping: Utilized BeautifulSoup to scrape weather data from the specified latitude and longitude.
-	Data Extraction: Extracted temperature, weather condition, location, humidity, rainfall, and current time from the website.
-	Streamlit Interface: Developed a user-friendly interface using Streamlit, allowing users to input latitude and longitude.
-	Styling: Applied custom CSS for improved visual presentation of the app.

Challenges Faced:
-	Data Extraction: Ensuring accurate extraction of weather data from the website's HTML structure.
-	Styling: Designing a visually appealing interface for better user experience.
-	Error Handling: Implementing robust error handling to gracefully manage invalid inputs or website changes.

Improvements with More Time:
-	Unit Conversion: Adding options for users to choose between different temperature and rainfall units (e.g., Celsius, Fahrenheit, millimeters, inches).
-	Historical Data: Incorporating functionality to retrieve historical weather data based on a selected date range.
-	User Authentication: Implementing user accounts to save favorite locations or preferences.
-	Caching Mechanism: Implementing a caching mechanism to store previously fetched data for faster retrieval and reduced load times.
-	Enhanced UI/UX: Further improving the app's visual design and layout for a more intuitive user experience.
-	Mobile Responsiveness: Ensuring the app is responsive on mobile devices for accessibility.

Code Structure:
-	The code consists of a function `scrape_weather` to fetch weather data from the specified latitude and longitude.
-	Streamlit UI elements are used to create input fields for latitude and longitude, along with a button to trigger data retrieval.
-	The retrieved weather data is then displayed in a formatted manner using HTML and CSS styling.

This summary highlights the development of a simple yet effective real-time weather app using Streamlit and web scraping techniques. Additional features and enhancements can be implemented to make the app more robust and user-friendly.
